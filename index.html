    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Lena, and I am passionate about lifeâ€™s simple joys, 
        like eating delicious food and getting enough sleep. 
        Beyond that, I have a curious mind and love exploring the secrets of the world around us. 
        Whether it is through learning in my Data Science class or keeping up with the latest in technology, 
        I am always excited to dive into new areas and challenge myself. 
        This website is a reflection of the things that bring me joy, inspire me, and drive my creativity. 
        I hope it gives you a glimpse into my interests and personality!</p>
    <p> A bit about my background: I was born in Vietnam and spent the first 15 years of my life there, 
        surrounded by a vibrant culture and close-knit community. It was a big change for me to move to the United States. 
        It showed me a world of new opportunities and different cultures. Even though it has not always been easy, 
        moving to a new country has been an amazing journey of growth and self-discovery. 
        I have liked getting to know people from different backgrounds, 
        learning about society, and making a life that is the best of both worlds. <p>
    <p>    Feel free to explore my site to know more about me!<p>
    <p>One more thing about me that is I love Cat! I wish I have one now!</p>
