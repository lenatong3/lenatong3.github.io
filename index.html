    <h2>About My Hobby</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my photography website! 
        I am Lena, an photographer who loves capturing the beauty of everyday moments. 
        My photography journey began with capturing the morning sky at the beach. 
        From landscape shots to candid portraits, I find joy in the little details. 
        On this website, I will be sharing my work and discussing my creative process. 
        I hope you enjoy browsing through my gallery as much as I enjoyed capturing these moments!</p>
    <p>
       Why I Love Photography? Photography has always been a way for me to express my creativity and capture the beauty of everyday moments. 
       I first became interested in photography when I had my first phone and I made out every first pictures. 
       Whether I am shooting landscapes, portraits, or street scenes, photography allows me to freeze moments in time and share my unique perspective with others. 
       What I love most about photography is the way it makes me look at the world differently. 
       I pay attention to details I might otherwise missâ€”like the way light filters through trees during golden hour or the vibrant colors in a crowded market. 
       Photography pushes me to explore new places and meet new people, expanding my understanding of the world. 
       I also enjoy experimenting with different techniques, from macro photography, where I focus on tiny details, 
       to dramatic black-and-white images that highlight contrast and emotion. 
       Photography has become a form of storytelling for me, allowing me to communicate emotions and experiences without words. 
       It is an ongoing journey of learning and discovery, and I look forward to continuing to grow as a photographer.
